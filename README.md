# Flex Phase 3 Project Build Backend Frontend
This is the react front end for my Phase-3 project for the Flatiron School. This is a companion app that can track which cocktails the user wishes to remember.

### Requirements
Latest Version of React


### How to use
First, please fork and clone the github repository to your local machine. Then in your terminal cd into the project directory and type "npm install" in order to install the dependencies. Look for the "reviewsOnCard" branch and switch to this branch-this is the one that holds the most up to date information. 

Then run "npm start" in order to run the development server.

The user can scroll through the seeded cocktails that are present. To add a cocktail, simply type the name and add the image url in the form at the top. Then click add. Reviews can be left on each cocktail card through the input box on the card itself. The cocktail name and image can be edited through usage of the "edit" button and removing the cocktail, in its entirety, with "delete".
